Dropseq: Sequencing Overview
===

<div>
<img src="images/dropseq_assay_1.png" height=500>
</div>

Dropseq: Microfluidics
===

![drop_beads](images/dropseq_drops.gif)

Dropseq: Equipment
===

![dropseq_eq](images/dropseq_equipment.png)

Dropseq: Pointers
===

- Droplet-based assays can have leaky RNA.
- Before library generation wash off any medium (inhibits library generation).
- Adding PBS and BSA (0.05-0.01%) can protect the cell.
  - Too much produces a residue making harvesting the beads difficult.
- Filter all reagent with a 80 micron strainer before microfluidics.
- Some purchased devices add a hydrophobic coating.
  - Can deteriorate (2 months at best).
  - Recoating does work (in-house).

10X: Massively Parallel Sequencing
===

<div>
<img src="images/10X_paper.png" height=500>
</div>

10X: Description
===

- Droplet-based, 3' mRNA.
  - GEM (Gel Bead in Emulsion)

Comparing Assays
===

<div>
<img src="images/compare_power_paper.png" height=500>
</div>

Comparing Assays
===

Based on ERCC spike-ins.   

**Accuracy:** How well the abundance levels correlated with known spiked-in amounts.   

**Sensitivity:** Minimum number of input RNA molecules required to detect a spike-in.   

Comparing Assays
===

Svensson et al. 2016
<div>
<img src="images/compare_assays.png" height=500>
</div>

Comparing Assays
===

- Different assays have different throughput.
  - SmartSeq2 < Dropseq < 10X
- SmartSeq2 is full transcript.
- Plate-based methods get lysed in wells and so do not leak.
  - Droplet-based can have leaky RNA.
- In Dropseq assays RT happens outside the droplets
  - Can use harsher lysis buffers.
  - 10X needs lysis buffers compatible with the RT enzyme.
- 10X is more standardized and comes with a pipeline.
  - Dropseq is more customizable but more hands-on.
- Cost per library varies greatly.

A Word on Sorting
===

- After disassociating cells cells can be performed.
- Know your cells, are they sticky, are they big?
  - Select an appropriate sized nozzle.
- Don't sort too quickly (1-2k cells per second or lower)
  - the slower the more time cells sit in lysis after sorting
    - 10 minutes max in lysis (some say 30 minutes)
- Calibrate speed of instrument with beads
  - Check alignment every 5-6 plates
- Afterwards spin down to make sure cells are in lysis buffer
  - Flash freeze

===

**Read Counts**
 
![reads](images/reads.png)

---

 **Counts by UMIs**
 
![umi](images/umi.png)

Summary of the Data
===

- We are still understanding scData and how to apply it.
  - Data can be NOT normal.
  - Data can be Zero-inflated.
  - Data can be very noisy.
  - Cells vary in library complexity.
- Keeping these characteristics in analysis assumptions.
- Trend to filter more conservatively with UMIs.

Introduction to RStudio
===

![bed](images/corgis/dogbutt.jpg)

Motivation: Why Am I Using R?
===

- A lot of method development is happening in R.
- Free / open source / open science.
- Many supplemental computational biology packages.
- Data science is an art.
  - Data often requires one to create and manipulate analysis.
- This will allow you to experience key concepts in analysis.

RStudio (IDE)
===

![rstudio_overview](images/Rstudio_overview.png)

Initial data exploration
===

![professor corgi](images/corgis/professor_corgi.jpg)

Seurat
===

![suerat](images/seurat_pubs.png)

Seurat: Today's Data
===

- Using data provided by 10X (2700 cells).
- Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
  - Any peripheral blood cell with a round nucleus.
  - Lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, NK cells)
  - Monocytes
- Complex mix cell populations used in immunity.

Logistics
===
class:small-code

- R allows methodology written by others to be imported.
  - Leverage other code.
  - Make your code available to others.  

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(dplyr) # Dataframe manipulation
library(Matrix) # Sparse matrices
library(useful) # Corner function
library(vioplot) # Violin pots
library(scater) # Single Cell QC
library(scde) # Differential Expression
library(org.Hs.eg.db) # Gene name manipulation
library(Seurat) # Single cell General Analysis
```

Representing Sparse Matrices
===

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
# Load 10X data
pbmc.10X <- Read10X("./data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19")

# Memory use as a sparse matrix
object.size(pbmc.10X)

# Memory use as a dense matrix
# 18 X more
object.size(as.matrix(pbmc.10X))
```

How are Sparse Representations Made?
===

- Sparse Matrix: A matrix where most of the elements are 0.
- Dense Matrix: A matrix where most elements are not 0.
- In this case, underlying data structure is a coordinate list.

2D Arrays vs Coordinate List
===

![sparse](images/sparseMatrices.png)

Create a Seurat Object
===

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
# Expected raw counts (non-normalized data)
# Can give log transformed data but do not transform in setup method
pbmc.seurat <- new("seurat", raw.data=pbmc.10X)
```

What is in a Seurat Object?
===

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
# Display the internal pieces of the Seurat Object
slotNames(pbmc.seurat)
```

What is in a Seurat Object?
===

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# Display the internal pieces of the Seurat Object
slotNames(pbmc.seurat)
```

What is in a Seurat Object?
===

Raw sparse matrix

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
head(pbmc.seurat@raw.data)
```

What is in a Seurat Object?
===

- __var.genes__ Variable genes across cells
- __data.info__ Misc info including complexity (nGene) 
- __cell.names__ Column (cell) names 
- __gene.names__ Row (gene) names

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
?seurat
```

Always Look at Your Data
===
class:midcenter

_**Hiding within those mounds of data is knowledge that could change the life of a patient, or change the world.**_  -– Atul Butte

What are Our Genes?
===
class:small-code

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
# Gene names (row names)
head(row.names(pbmc.seurat@raw.data))
length(row.names(pbmc.seurat@raw.data))
```

# Column names
# Sample / Cell names / Barcodes
head(colnames(pbmc.seurat@raw.data))
length(colnames(pbmc.seurat@raw.data))
```

How to Show Counts?
===
class:small-code

```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE,tidy=FALSE}
# Only the corner
# The full data will be too large to see
corner(as.matrix(pbmc.seurat@raw.data))
```

How to Show Counts?
===
class:small-code

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE,tidy=FALSE}
# Only the corner
# The full data will be too large to see
corner(as.matrix(pbmc.seurat@raw.data))
```

Complexity of Libraries
===

- Very important metadata.
- How many genes had a count of more than 1 in a cell.
  - Simplest, most common definition.

How Many Expressed Genes (Complexity)?
===
class:small-code

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Plot genes per cell
# How many genes expressed per cells
complexity.per.cell <- apply(pbmc.seurat@raw.data, 2, function(x) sum(x>0))
# Mean count per cell.
mean.count.per.cell <- apply(pbmc.seurat@raw.data, 2, function(x) mean(x))
# Gene prevalence
gene.prevalence <- apply(pbmc.seurat@raw.data, 1, function(x) sum(x>0))
```

How Many Expressed Genes (Complexity)?
===
class:small-code

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Plot genes per cell
# How many genes expressed per cell
vioplot(complexity.per.cell)
stripchart(complexity.per.cell, add=TRUE, vertical=TRUE, method="jitter", jitter=0.3, pch=19)
abline(h=200, col="red")
abline(h=2500, col="blue")
title("Study Complexity")
axis(side=1,at=1,labels=c("Study"))
```

How Many Expressed Genes (Complexity)?
===
class:small-code

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# Plot genes per cell
# How many genes expressed per cell
vioplot(complexity.per.cell)
stripchart(complexity.per.cell, add=TRUE, vertical=TRUE, method="jitter", jitter=0.3, pch=19)
abline(h=200, col="red")
abline(h=2500, col="blue")
title("Study Complexity")
axis(side=1,at=1,labels=c("Study"))
```

---

- Shown complexity of all cells in a study. 
- Wide range of complexity.
- Prefiltered data at red line.
- Will define points about the blue line as outlier.

Box Plots vs Violin Plots
===
class:small-code

**Boxplot:**  
Robust representation of a distribution using quantiles

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
boxplot(complexity.per.cell)
title("Study Complexity")
axis(side=1,at=1,labels=c("Study"))
```

---

**Violin Plot:**  
Box plot with kernel density plot mirrored on sides.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
vioplot(complexity.per.cell)
title("Study Complexity")
axis(side=1,at=1,labels=c("Study"))
```

Identifying Outliers?
===
class:small-code

- Cells that are unusually simple (or no counts)
- Cells that are unusually complex (doublets?)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
plot(complexity.per.cell,log2(mean.count.per.cell+1))
abline(v=200, col="red")
abline(h=log2(4))
```

Identifying Outliers?
===
class:small-code

- We will filter in a standard way, we are just describing the data.
- Red line shows a point of prefiltering.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
plot(complexity.per.cell,mean.count.per.cell+1)
abline(v=200, col="red")
abline(h=log2(4))
```

Identifying Noise?
===
class:small-code

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
#hist(gene.prevalence)
hist(log2(gene.prevalence))
abline(v=3, col="red")
```

Identifying Noise?
===
class:small-code

- People tend to filter very conservatively.
- 3 is where we will filter (red line).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
#hist(gene.prevalence)
hist(log2(gene.prevalence))
abline(v=3, col="red")
```

Filter Cells: Removing the Outlier Cells
===
class:small-code

- Genes must be in 3 cells with alteast 200 genes.
- Scaled by 1000 (Total Sum Scaling)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
pbmc.seurat <- Setup(pbmc.seurat,
                    min.cells=3, min.genes=200,
                    do.logNormalize=TRUE,
                    total.expr=1e4,
                    project="Tutorial")
```

Expression: Definition
===

**Population based RNA-Seq**
- Different ways to move from counts to expression.
- EM algorithms (RSEM)
- TPM with TMM normalization.
  - Control for transcript length and force the depth to be 10^6.
  - Trimmed means weighted focusing on invariant genes through samples.

**Today we are using**
- log2( ( cell_counts / cell_sum ) * 1000 + 1 )
- Account for sequencing depth.

write.table(as.matrix(pbmc.seurat@data), file="seurat_data.txt")

# Study metadata
write.table(pbmc.seurat@data.info, file="seurat_metadata.txt")

# What is the metadata so far
head(pbmc.seurat@data.info)
```

Scater: Complex QC Plotting
===

![scater_paper](images/scater_paper.png)

Scater: Motivation
===

- Clinical studies are often rich with metadata.
- Most differential expression methodology is T-test.
  - Much like using covariates in linear regression to control here we stratify by metadata to describe the impact of the metadatum.
- More than what we are covering here.
- Online tutorial [Click Here](//bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/scater/inst/doc/vignette.html)

Section Summary
===

- scRNA-Seq is complex and can NOT be treated as population based measurements.
- Cell complexity is an important metadatum for QC.
- Conservative gene filtering based on gene count and prevalence is often used.
- Cells can be filtered by complexity and also other metadatum.

Where are we at?
===

We have now
- Loaded in data into R.
- Explored and plotted the data for QC.
- Filtered on counts and metadata.

Next
- Focus on plotting Genes and Cells.
- View cell groups to later use in DE.

Dimensionality reduction and plotting (PCA, t-SNE)
===

![outlier_corgi](images/corgis/outlier_corgi.jpg)

Dimensionality Reduction and Ordination
===

- Start with many measurements (high dimensional).
  - Want to reduce to a few features (lower-dimensional space).
- One way is to extract features based on capturing groups of variance.
- Another could be to preferentially select some of the current features.
  - We have already done this.
- We need this to plot the cells in 2D (or ordinate them)
- In scRNA-Seq PC1 may be complexity.

PCA: in Quick Theory
===

- Eigenvectors of covariance matrix.
- Find orthogonal groups of variance.
- Given from most to least variance.
  - Components of variation.
  - Linear combinations explaining the variance.

PCA and t-SNE Together
===

Often t-SNE is performed on PCA components
- Liberal number of components.
- Removes mild signal (assumption of noise).
- Faster, on less data but, hopefully the same signal.

Seurat: Choosing Components
===
class:small-code

How do we choose how many components to use?   
 - When there is diminishing returns to include it.
 - Selection is performed more liberally in our setting.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Scree (elbow) plot
PCElbowPlot(pbmc.seurat)
```

Seurat: Choosing Components
===
class:small-code

Seurat: Store Clusters
===
class:small-code

- Determine subclusters for the plot.
- Separate graph based approach.
   - is not aware of the t-SNE projection.
- Using PC 1-10

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# 1 minute
pbmc.seurat <- FindClusters(pbmc.seurat, pc.use = 1:10, resolution = 0.6, print.output = 0, save.SNN = TRUE)

class:small-code

- Calculate and plot t-SNE on PC 1- 10.   
- Uses Barnes-hut implementation.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Calculate t-SNE Ordination
pbmc.seurat <- RunTSNE(pbmc.seurat, dims.use = 1:10, do.fast = TRUE)
# Plot
TSNEPlot(pbmc.seurat)

This is not PCA
- Distance is best understood in close neighbors.
- The measurement of distance is difficult to understand.

Seurat: Plotting Genes Through Clusters
===
class:small-code

Now that we have subclusters of cell populations plotting genes through subclusters is identical to before.
- Seurat stores and groups by subclusters automatically.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
VlnPlot(pbmc.seurat, c("MS4A1","CD79A"))
```

```

Seurat: Plotting Genes on Clusters
===
class:small-code

You can also gene expression through out the cell ordination.
- Marker genes can help identify cell groups.
- Metadata can help visualize batch affects.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
FeaturePlot(pbmc.seurat, c("MS4A1","CD3E", "GNLY", "FCER1A"), cols.use = c("grey","blue"))
```

```

Confirm Cell Identity
===
class:small-code

It is important to know cells are expressing expected genes.
- Many cell populations have known expressing genes.
- Many assays use sorting.
- Could have contaminants or unexpected diversity.

QC the Clusters!

# Making Fake Data
fake.sites <- as.integer(pbmc.seurat@ident %in% c(5,2,8,7))
names(fake.sites) <- colnames(pbmc.seurat@data)
# Add metadata
pbmc.seurat <- AddMetaData(pbmc.seurat, fake.sites, "site")
# Plot feature

# Add metadata
pbmc.seurat <- AddMetaData(pbmc.seurat, fake.sites, "site")
# Plot feature
FeaturePlot(pbmc.seurat, c("site"), cols.use = c("orange","purple"))
```

Section Summary
===

- Dimensionality reduction help reduce data while *hopefully* keeping important signal.
  - t-SNE on PCA is often used in analysis
- Created several types of plot often seen in publications.
  - Plotting genes (through subgroups).
  - Ordinating cells in t-SNE space.

![confounding_paper](images/confounding_paper.png)

What is Confounding?
===

<div align="center">
<img src="images/confounding.png" height=500>
</div>

Confounding by Design
===

![batch_effects](images/batch_effects_4.png)

Between Sample Normalization and Batch Affect Correction
===

- The nature of scRNA-Seq assays can make them prone to confounding with batch affects.
  - Normalization and batch affect correction can help.
- Some are moving away from relying on a specific method.
  - Exploring the idea of combining or selecting from a collection of normalization or correction methods best for a specific study.
- Some believe UMI based analysis need not be normalized between samples given the absolute count of the molecules are being reported.
- For advanced analysis try [SCONE](//niryosef.wordpress.com/tools/scone) or another tool from the [awesome list](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell).
  - Be careful not to remove biological signal with good experimental design (avoiding confounding by design).

Differential Expression (SCDE)
===

![clump](images/corgis/corgi_clump.jpg)

SCDE: What is the Data?
===

- Data is from [Islam et al. 2011](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/7/1160.long)
- Approximately 100 samples.
  - Caution we use less...
- Mouse cells
  - Embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; control)
  - Embryonic stem cells (ES)

SCDE: Single Cell Differential Expression
===

![scde_intro](images/scde_intro.png)

SCDE: in Quick Theory
===

For each group (ES or MEF).
- Genes are modeled to have two groups of counts.
  - Noisy area highly prone to dropout (Poisson distribution).
  - "Amplified" signal (Negative Binomial distribution).
- This makes the error model to understand how much one can trust counts.
- Pairwise within groups.

Differential Expression.
- Expected value * the probability of dropout in that cell for that expression level.

SCDE: Load Data
===
class:small-code

- Pull in the data for the tutorial.
- In the future you would read in the data.
  - Read.table or load Seurat object.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,tidy=FALSE}
data(es.mef.small)
```

SCDE: Filter
===
class:small-code

- Filter the noise.
  - Almost every package has a function for this.
  - Filtering on gene prevalence.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,tidy=FALSE}
dim(es.mef.small)
cd <- clean.counts(es.mef.small, min.lib.size=1000, min.reads = 1, min.detected = 1)
dim(cd)
```

SCDE: Create Labels
===
class:small-code

- Let's labels for the two groups.

```{r,eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,tidy=FALSE}
## Setting up cells groups
data.groups <- rep(NA, ncol(es.mef.small))
data.groups[ grep("MEF", names(es.mef.small)) ] <- "MEF"
data.groups[ grep("ESC", names(es.mef.small)) ] <- "ESC"
data.groups <- factor(data.groups, levels = c("ESC","MEF"))
names(data.groups) <- colnames(es.mef.small)
table(data.groups)
```

SCDE: Calculate Error Models
===
class:small-code

- Some steps in SCDE can be time intensive.   
  - For the tutorial we will read in the result of this step.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,tidy=FALSE}
## Calculate error models
## Time Intensive step
# o.ifm <- scde.error.models(counts=cd, groups= data.groups, n.cores=4,
#                           threshold.segmentation=TRUE, save.crossfit.plots=FALSE,

data.groups[ grep("MEF", rownames(o.ifm)) ] <- "MEF"
data.groups[ grep("ESC", rownames(o.ifm)) ] <- "ESC"
data.groups <- factor(data.groups, levels = c("ESC","MEF"))
names(data.groups) <- row.names(o.ifm)

## Perform T-test like analysis
# 2 minutes on standard computer, 1 core
#ediff <- scde.expression.difference(o.ifm, cd, o.prior, groups=data.groups, n.randomizations=100, n.cores=2, verbose=1)

Section Summary
===

- Generated groups of cells (labels) from subclusters.
- DE can be performed on cell subclusters.
  - Addresses the specific characteristics of the underlying data.
  - Is a t-test not an ANOVA
  - Can be time intensive.
- Pathway enrichment analysis can be performed using de novo and established gene groupings.

What Did We Miss? (So Much)
===

- Seurat
  - Data imputation, spatial inference, batch effect correction, ...
- SCDE
  - Batch Effect Correction, ...
- Pseudotemporal Analysis (time-series)
  - Monocle2, ...
- So many more tools are emerging, ...

What did we accomplish?
===

- Looked at the data and performed filtering and QC
- Plot genes and cells.
- Discovered subgroups of cells.
- Groups of cells were used as labels in DE.
- Groups of genes were analyzed for enrichment.

Notes: to Make a PDF
===
class:small-code

- Create a pdf file before you plot ( can plot multiple plots ).
- Close the plotting.

```{r,eval=FALSE,tidy=TRUE}
#pdf( "data/my_file.pdf", useDingbats = FALSE ) # Start pdf
#plot( 1:10, log(1:10 ) ) # plot in to the pdf file
#plot( seq(0,.9,.1), sin(0:9) ) # another plot for the pdf file
#dev.off() # Close pdf file ( very important )
```
